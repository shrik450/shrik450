# Welcome to my GitHub page!

if you're here, it's *probably* because you scanned the QR code on my resume. Thank you for your interest! 

Here's my [LinkedIn Account,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrikup/) which contains most of the same stuff as in my resume.

Some stuff that isn't resume-worthy, but still describes me:

- I'm super interested in functional programming, and OCaml is the language that feels most like *home*. At the same time, I'm very pratical about what I work with, so for the most part I use the lessons I learn from messing around with functional programming to write better code in $DAY_JOB_LANG. I've done this to make code safer, more testable and easier to reason while working professionally in both Java and Ruby, and I hope to keep that up!
- I'm trying to write! [Here's a post I wrote I really like](https://blog.shrikanthup.com/2021-12-04-ecto-data/). I have a lot of drafts and not enough finished posts :( (someday...)
- I'm currently exploring Rust, which I find fascinating if slightly hard to use.
