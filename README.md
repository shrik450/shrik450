# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science student at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), and I'm looking for internships for Summer 2023. I'm available May through August 2023. [Here's my LinkedIn Account,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrikup/) which contains most of the same stuff as in my resume. If you'd like to connect and don't have my email/number, please send me a connection request on LinkedIn!

Some stuff that isn't resume-worthy, but still describes me:

- I'm super interested in functional programming, and OCaml is the language that feels most like *home*. At the same time, I'm very pratical about what I work with, so for the most part I use the lessons I learn from messing around with functional programming to write better code in $DAY_JOB_LANG. I've done this to make code safer, more testable and easier to reason while working professionally in both Java and Ruby, and I hope to keep that up!
- I'm trying to write! [Here's a post I wrote I really like](https://blog.shrikanthup.com/2021-12-04-ecto-data/). I have a lot of drafts and not enough finished posts :( (someday...)
- I'm currently exploring Rust, which I find fascinating if slightly hard to use. 
- I'm [JLPT N2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test#Test_format) certified.
