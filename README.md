# Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a Software Engineer at [AllSpice](https://www.allspice.io/), and most recently before that graduated with a Master's of Engineering in CS at Virginia Tech. [Here's my LinkedIn Account,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrikup/) which contains most of the same stuff as in my resume. If you'd like to connect and don't have my email/number, please send me a connection request on LinkedIn!

Some stuff that isn't resume-worthy, but still describes me:

- I'm super interested in functional programming, and ~OCaml~ Rust[^1] is the language that feels most like *home*. At the same time, I'm very pratical about what I work with, so for the most part I use the lessons I learn from messing around with functional programming to write better code in $DAY_JOB_LANG. I've done this to make code safer, more testable and easier to reason while working professionally in both Java and Ruby, and I hope to keep that up!
- I'm trying to write! My blog is "just" a GitHub repo. [Here's my newest post.](https://github.com/shrik450/blog/blob/main/2024/typescript.md)
- I'm [JLPT N2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test) certified.

[^1]: I've reached a level of proficiency with Rust that has made it my first-choice language in 2024.
